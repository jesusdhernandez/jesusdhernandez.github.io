## What have I done this week?

This week, I've mostly focused on making my website function for exhibition. I've added most of the background functionality to make everything that I want to work, work! This includes things such as a click-to-show-context function, as well as adding an easy way to add columns to the site to make better use of space. Last but not least, I added the functionality for all images to open in a new tab if clicked upon, and also show a shadow when hovered on. The most significant thing I've learned this week has been properly using inline and block elements on a website for layout. A struggle I'm facing is that the hard drives I ordered for my NAS project weeks ago turned out to be a scam, and now I neither have the time or money to order replacements. Unfortunately, that project will have to be omitted from exhibition as a result. It's definitely my low, as I was super excited to work on that part of the project. My high this week has probably been seeing my website come together so far, which I'm honestly proud of considering my lack of web design skills. Next week, I will finish and finalize my website for exhibition, which should only take a day or two at most! My tasks for next week are to finish the Apache page, add more defition pop-ups for new terms, and make sure the website runs as intended for exhibition.

# Learning Goal Progress

1. How to use Linux in a server environment

> I can demonstrate how Apache Subversion can be used to manage a website in development.

2. How to manage and apply virtual machines in an enterprise environment

> I can describe how to use virtual machines in order to deploy different services - such as a workstation and website.

3. The ins and outs of RAID arrays, as well as their importance in servers

> I can still describe the different levels of RAID. I haven't lost that knowledge. However, I also can't apply it. Thanks, eBay.
