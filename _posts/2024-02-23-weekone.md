## What have I done this week?

This week, I have installed CentOS 7, a Linux distro, on my computer. It currently contains and runs two different virtual machines, which run another instance of CentOS 7, as well as Ubuntu 23.10. Last but not least, I have used Apache HTTP in order to create and host a website locally, which uses self-signed certificate SSL in order to serve on the more secure HTTPS protocol, rather than the standard, less secure HTTP protocol. The most significant thing I have learned from my research this week is how to configure Cockpit on my host machine in order to remotely oversee both the host machine and my virtual machines on a completely separate system! However, my biggest struggle that I have been facing thus far is things unexpectedly breaking. Unfortunately for absolutely everybody involved, having the freedom to configure every miniature thing yourself has the guarantee that you'll break something somewhere down the line without even knowing it, and this sure has occurred very, very often. Next week, I will be trying to fix my own issues more often than not, rather than asking for help on them. I feel as though this should make me less reliant on others. A personal high for me this week was getting my HTTPS site to function on the first try, as I've been highly accustomed to causing 20 new errors for every 1 that I fix. On that topic, my low this week has been being unable to diagnose many of the errors that I've caused on my own. Next week, I will set up SSH to more easily manage each of my virtual machines, install Apache Subversion (also known as SVN), and start work on my TrueNAS project that I will present for exhibition.

# Learning Goal Progress

1. How to use Linux in a server environment

> I understand many new commands that are commonly used in Linux, especially in CentOS 7, as I have spent this entire week learning them, and beginning to use these new commands.

2. How to manage and apply virtual machines in an enterprise environment

> I can demonstrate how to use QEMU KVM in order to create multiple virtual machines that run different operating systems within them.

3. The ins and outs of RAID arrays, as well as their importance in servers

> I learned the different levels of RAID that can be used on a NAS.
