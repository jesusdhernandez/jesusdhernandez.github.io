## What have I done this week?

This week, I did a lot of tidying up what I currently had. For example, I reconfigured the network on the host computer in order to setup a bridge for the virtual machines. In short, bridging the host network means that instead of giving the virtual machines apartment unit numbers under one street address as their IP address, they are instead directly given their own individual street addresses. This is especially useful for accessing the virtual machines anywhere on the network, as they were previously inaccessible. Additionally, I setup Apache Subversion on my website as its own directory. Apache Subversion is a piece of software that tracks any change made to a repository, and easily syncs it up with multiple clients at the same time. I feel as though that is my most significant thing I've learned this week. If there were a struggle to be had, I would say that correctly configuring subversion was a huge headache. There are version disparities between the different operating systems, so there were more errors during setup than there was any progress. However, once I got it up and running, I was extremely proud of myself; that was definitely my high for the week. Next week, I will be starting to properly design a website's landing page, start thinking about how I will present my work at Festival Del Sol, and begin designing my website off of what I will present there.

# Learning Goal Progress

1. How to use Linux in a server environment

> I can demonstrate how to install and configure Apache Subversion on multiple Linux distributions.

2. How to manage and apply virtual machines in an enterprise environment

> I can desmonstrate how to replace a virtual NAT with a bridge network on Linux when working with virtual machines.

3. The ins and outs of RAID arrays, as well as their importance in servers

> I can demonstrate what the different levels of RAID are, as well as their advantages and disadvantages.
