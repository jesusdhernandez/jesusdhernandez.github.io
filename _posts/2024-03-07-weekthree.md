_The beginning of my Festival Del Sol-presentable website._

## What have I done this week?

This week, I spearheaded my way into my website-from-scratch mini-project. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to create most, if not all, of the backend of my server. From only trial and error, my website has a working navigation bar, as well as button shadow and dark highlighting whenever it is hovered over with a mouse cursor. Additionally, it has a fully functional toggle between light and dark themes, which took me the longest time to implement. I'd say that my most significant thing I've learnt this week was definitely utilizing localStorage in JavaScript in order to store a user's theme preference for the next time they come to visit the page (I implemented it for quality of life, it was no requirement by any means). Realistically, my only struggle for this would be figuring out how I want to format everything on my site in order for it to look aesthetically pleasing. Next week, I will focus more on website design and creating visual elements, rather than prioritizing working with Linux. A personal high for me has been getting the theme toggle to work flawlessly, whilst a low has been realizing how long it's been taking me to get anything done on the frontend. My tasks for next week are to finish the website, create visual diagrams that represent the project, and learn more about website design.

# Learning Goal Progress

1. How to use Linux in a server environment

> I can describe how to setup and use Apache Subversion for a project between multiple clients, especially for a website.

2. How to manage and apply virtual machines in an enterprise environment

> I can demonstrate why and how an application server can be isolated from a client server, as well as the importance of it.

3. The ins and outs of RAID arrays, as well as their importance in servers

> I understand where RAID may be used, as well as why.
