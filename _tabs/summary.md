My senior project is mostly an **Internship** with the school's IT department, as well as a **TrueNAS Backup** machine that is capable of automatically backing up photos from a phone using [Immich](https://immich.app), similar to how [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com) functions, except that it is hosted on a local computer. Throughout my internship, I will learn about the fundamentals of virtualization, as well as how to apply it to enterprise-wide solutions.

# Learning Goals

## 1. How to use Linux in a server environment

> Contrary to most computers at home, servers almost always run on Linux-based operating systems, and is therefore important to understand.

## 2. How to manage and apply virtual machines in an enterprise environment

> Virtual machines are often deployed in servers in order to isolate services from each other. This is important for both security and modularity.

## 3. The ins and outs of RAID arrays, as well as their importance in servers

> RAID, standing for "Redundant Array of Independent Disks," combines multiple physical storage drives into one for many different applications.
